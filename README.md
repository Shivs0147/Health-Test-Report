# 🧪 Test.xlsx – Structured Medical Report (Based on PDF Lab Reports)

<p align = 'justify'> This repository contains a manually created and well-structured Excel file (`Test.xlsx`) that compiles multiple diagnostic test results into a single, organized workbook. The report is built entirely in Excel, based on unformatted original lab report PDFs.
</p>

## 📁 File Overview

[Test.xlsx](https://github.com/Shivs0147/Health-Test-Dashboard/blob/main/Test.xlsx) (download here)


<p align = 'justify'>This Excel file was **manually designed** to present lab test results in a clean, tabular format for easier tracking and comparison across dates.</p>

#### 🔹 Sheet 1: `Test Report`

- Test names listed vertically (e.g., Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, eGFR, etc.)
- Each column after the first represents a **lab test result date** (from 2020 to 2025)
- Includes:
  - Reference ranges (Min and Max)
  - Units (e.g., mg/dL, mL/min/1.73m²)
- Clear layout for longitudinal analysis or dashboard integration

#### 🔹 Sheet 2: `Report`

<p align = 'justify'>

- Focuses on Phosphorus test results over time (20/12/2020 to 01/06/2025) with min/max reference intervals, alongside urinalysis data (e.g., Urine-Color, Appearance, WBC Esterase, Protein, Glucose, Ketones, Occult Blood, Bilirubin, Nitrite Urine).
